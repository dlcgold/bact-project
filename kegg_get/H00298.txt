NAME        Yersiniosis
DESCRIPTION Yersiniosis (non-plague) is an infectious disease caused by two species, Yersinia enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis, which is zoonotic, capable of being transmitted from infected animals to man. Routes of transmission include fecal-oral spread via ingestion of contaminated food as the most common route and consumption of contaminated water supplies. Yersiniosis occurs more commonly in regions with temperate rather than tropical or subtropical climates.
