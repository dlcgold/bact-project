NAME        Enterobacter infection
DESCRIPTION Enterobacter infections are commonly found in nosocomial settings and Enterobacter spp. have been recognized as increasingly important pathogens. They are intrinsically resistant to aminopenicillins, cefazolin, and cefoxitin because they produce constitutive chromosome AmpC beta-lactamase. Enterobacter spp. are recovered from the respiratory tract, surgical wounds, urinary tract, and blood and are implicated in a broad range of clinical syndromes.
