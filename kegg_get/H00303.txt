NAME        Serratia infection
DESCRIPTION Serratia species are gram-negative bacilli of the Enterobacteriaceae that cause hospital-acquired infection. Numerous outbreaks have been reported in association with medical devices and neonatal intensive care unit. S. marcescens strains that have been involved in outbreaks have often been resistant to multiple antibiotics.
