NAME        Brucellosis
DESCRIPTION Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease of worldwide distribution that mainly affects persons working with domestic animals. Although many countries have eradicated Brucella abortus from cattle, Brucella melitensis remains a major cause of infection in cattle and human in Latin America, the Middle East, Spain, parts of Africa, and western Asia. Consumption of contaminated foods is the sources of infection. The clinical presentation can vary from asymptomatic infection to a fever, night sweats, and joint manifestations.
