ENTRY       H00352                      Disease
NAME        Whipple disease
DESCRIPTION Whipple disease (WD) is a rare chronic multi-system disease associated with the bacterium Tropheryma whipplei that is ubiquitously present in the environment. The clinical features of WD are non-specific and histological lesions in gastrointestinal system can be the major manifestations. Patients without symptoms of gastrointestinal disease might be insufficiently treated, resulting in a potentially fatal outcome such as endocarditis, neurological infection, osteoarticular infection, or uveitis.
