NAME        Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infection
DESCRIPTION Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a ubiquitous organism found in practically all natural environments with water content. In hospital environments, it is frequently found as a contaminant in many devices, infusion solutions, sterile water and is associated with hospital-acquired infections in patients with compromised immunity. S. maltophilia has been isolated from various clinical settings and the respiratory tract is the most common site of infection.
