ENTRY       H01070                      Disease
NAME        Vibrio furnissii infection
DESCRIPTION Vibrio furnissii, first described as a gasproducing biovar of V. fluvialis, is associated with human acute gastroenteritis. The pathology of V. furnissii in gastroenteritis is potentially related to hemolysin production. A protein with multifaceted functions in solute binding, in in vitro hemolysis, in antibiotic resistance, and as a virulence factor in bacterial pathogenesis has been identified.
