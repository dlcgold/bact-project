NAME        Shewanella infection
DESCRIPTION Shewanella putrefaciens and Shewanella algae, which are frequently found in non-human sources, are opportunistically pathogenic for humans. Shewanella infection is associated with a wide clinical spectrum including bacteremia/septicemia, skin and soft-tissue infection, biliary tract infection, peritonitis, and empyema, and soft-tissue infection is most frequent. Bacteremia/septicemia can cause death in some cases.
