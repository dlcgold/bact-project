NAME        Human monocytic ehrlichiosis
DESCRIPTION Human monocytic ehrlichiosis is a tick-borne infectious disease caused by Ehrlichia chaffeensis that infects mononuclear phagocytic cells. The bacterium is maintained in nature involving many vertebrate species such as deer that serve as competent reservoirs for the bacterium and as sources of blood for tick vectors. Patients experience fever, malaise, low-back pain, or gastrointestinal symptoms.
