NAME        Agrobacterium radiobacter infection
DESCRIPTION Agrobacteria are small, gram-negative bacilli widely distributed in soil. They are best known for the phytopathogenicity, causing tumorigenic disease in plants. However, Agrobacterium spp. are also recognized as rare human pathogens affecting mostly immunocompromised or chronically debilitated hosts and patients with indwelling catheters. Clinical manifestations include bacteremia, peritonitis, and deltoid muscle myositis.
