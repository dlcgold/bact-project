NAME        Aggressive periodontitis
DESCRIPTION Aggressive periodontitis is a disease of the periodontium occurring in an otherwise healthy adolescent, which is characterized by a rapid loss of alveolar bone around more than one tooth of the permanent dentition. Because it tends to have a familial aggregation, host predisposition seems to play a key role in the pathogenesis of aggressive periodontitis. It occurs in localized and generalized forms.
