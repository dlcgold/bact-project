ENTRY       H01339                      Disease
NAME        Asymptomatic bacteriuria
DESCRIPTION The term asymptomatic bacteriuria is generally used to distinguish colonization from infection and to emphasize that the presence of bacteria at mucosal surfaces does not always cause symptoms and tissue damage. Asymptomatic bacteriuria has been attracting attention as a model to study mechanisms underlying the development of commensalism. Escherichia coli strain 83972 was isolated from the urine of a Swedish patient who was colonized for at least 3 years without displaying clinical signs of a urinary tract infection.
