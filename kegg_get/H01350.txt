NAME        Morganella morganii infection
DESCRIPTION The genera Morganella are gram-negative anaerobic rods and important opportunistic pathogens, which cause a wide variety of nosocomial infections following surgery. Morganella morganii can cause bacteremia and lead to major clinical problems, which are usually associated with common causes of catheter-associated bacteriuria, infections of the urinary and hepatobiliary tracts, wound infection, and septicemia.
