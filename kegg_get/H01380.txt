NAME        Bacterial vaginosis
DESCRIPTION Bacterial vaginosis (BV) flora is dominated by Gardnerella vaginalis and includes many anaerobic organisms as contrasted with normal lactobacillus-dominated vaginal flora. BV flora is thought to be related to vaginal discharge, poor pregnancy outcomes, pelvic inflammatory disease, postoperative wound infections, endometritis following elective abortions. Additionally, BV flora predisposes women to infection by HIV as well as other Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs).
