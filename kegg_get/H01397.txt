NAME        Tick-borne lymphadenopathy;
            Tick-borne lymphadenitis
DESCRIPTION Rickettsia species are arthropod-associated intracellular bacteria and cause diseases in human such as Tick-borne lymphadenopathy, Typhus fever and Spotted fever. Rickettsia slovaca has been isolated from Dermacentor ticks and is the main agent of tick-borne lymphadenopathy (TIBOLA), which is found only in Europe. Its symptoms are generally mild and can be characterized by inoculation eschar on the scalp and cervical lymphadenopathies after a tick bite. Moreover, most of the cases occur during European cool months related to the activity of Dermacentor ticks.
