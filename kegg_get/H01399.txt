NAME        Bacillus thuringiensis infection
DESCRIPTION Bacillus thuringiensis is a close taxonomic relative of Bacillus cereus and an insect pathogen that is widely used as a biopesticide. Additionally, this bacterium is known to induce myonecrosis in immunosuppressed mice after cutaneous infection. Human infection is unusual, and apart from gastrointestinal tract infections or those following laboratory contamination, there are only two clinical reports of B. thuringiensis infection. Both the cases were isolated from severe human tissue necrosis by burn wounds or severe war wounds.
