ENTRY       H01401                      Disease
NAME        Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) infection
DESCRIPTION The genus Staphylococcus known as pathogen of human and other mammals causes various diseases ranging from minor skin infections to life-threatening bacteremia. The two major opportunistic pathogens in the Staphylococcus genus, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermis, colonize a sizable portion of the human population. S. epidermidis as the predominant species is quite widespread throughout the cutaneous ecosystem, whereas S. aureus colonizes primarily on mucosal surfaces. Staphylococcal infections are commonly caused by S. aureus. However, the infections due to S. epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci have been also increasing. S. epidermidis is primarily associated with infections of implanted medical devices, such as prosthetic heart valves and joint prostheses.
