NAME        Lactococcus garvieae infection
DESCRIPTION Lactococcus garvieae, catalase-negative, facultative anaerobic cocci, is a major pathogen of fish and causes fatal hemorrhagic septicemia in fish such as yellowtail and trout, and it has also been isolated from buffaloes with mastitis, and clinical specimens of human blood, urine, and skin. However, it is an unusual human pathogen. Only a few infections have been described so far, including several cases of infective endocarditis on native or prosthetic valve, one case of osteomyelitis, and septicaemia with liver abscess.
