NAME        Saccharomonospora viridis infection
DESCRIPTION Saccharomonospora viridis is the type species of the genus Saccharomonospora which belongs to the family Pseudonocardiaceae. Members of the species are frequently found in hot compost and hay, and its spores can cause farmer's lung disease, bagassosis, and humidifier fever. Spores of S. viridis are readily dispersed in air, and the prolonged exposure to spores can apparently result in acute respiratory distress which may lead to irreversible lung damage.
