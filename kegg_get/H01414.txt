NAME        Hafnia alvei infection
DESCRIPTION The genus Hafnia, a member of the family Enterobacteriaceae, is occasionally implicated in both intestinal and extraintestinal infections in humans. Hafnia alvei is a facultative anaerobic opportunistic pathogen that is also known to play a role in microbial food spoilage. This species has been isolated from a wide range of nosocomial infections, including septicaemia, as well as respiratory, enteric, and urinary tract infections.
