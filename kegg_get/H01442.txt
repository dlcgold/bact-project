NAME        Septic arthritis;
            Pyogenic arthritis
DESCRIPTION Septic arthritis is defined as a purulent infection in a joint cavity. The infection commonly reaches the joint in children by hematogenous spread or by direct extension of pathogenic bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae type-b, and Group A Streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Kingela kingae, Neisseria meningiditis and Salmonella spp. are the predominant anaerobic bacteria that cause arthritis in children. One of the most predominant aetiologic agent of septic arthritis in all age groups is Staphylococcus aureus. Also, Gonococcal arthritis can occur in sexually active adolescents.
