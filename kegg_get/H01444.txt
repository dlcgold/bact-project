NAME        Enterococcal infection
DESCRIPTION Enterococci are Gram-positive, catalase-negative, non-spore-forming, facultative anaerobic bacteria, which usually inhabit the alimentary tract of humans in addition to being isolated from environmental and animal sources. The species of the greatest clinical importance are Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. Enterococcal infections include urinary tract infections, hepatobiliary sepsis, endocarditis, surgical wound infection, bacteraemia and neonatal sepsis.
