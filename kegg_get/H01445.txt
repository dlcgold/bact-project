NAME        Acne vulgaris
  SUPERGRP  Anaerobic infection [DS:H01410]
DESCRIPTION Acne is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit resulting from androgen-induced increased sebum production, altered keratinization, inflammation, and bacterial colonization of hair follicles on the face, neck, chest, and back by Propionibacterium acnes. P. acnes is a Gram-positive bacterium that forms part of the normal flora of the skin, oral cavity, large intestine, the conjunctiva and the external ear canal. Although P. acnes is primarily recognized for its role in acne, it's also famous as an opportunistic pathogen causing a range of postoperative and device-related infections.
