ENTRY       H01531                      Disease
NAME        Bejel;
            Endemic syphilis
DESCRIPTION Treponemal infections occurring in humans comprise venereal syphilis and the non-venereal endemic treponematoses. The non-venereal endemic treponematoses are yaws, pinta, and bejel. Bejel, also known as endemic syphilis, is endemic in many parts of the world including Saudi Arabia. The disease usually occurs in patients living in primitive environments with low standard of hygiene. Clinical manifestations of bejel are divided into various stages. Patches on the mucous membranes, angular stomatitis, nonitchy skin eruptions, and generalized lymphadenopathy are the most important early manifestations. In the late stage, affection of skin, bones, and cartilage may lead to severe destruction, especially of the nose and palate.
